# SA1 (DC) DLC Collection
A complete collection of all official and currently known SA1 DLC in .VMI & .VMS, with region lock removals, ID and CRC fixes!

All files are compressed into the .7z format, and thus the free program 7-zip (https://www.7-zip.org/) is required to download the files.

Unless you are doing research on the DLC, I do NOT recommend downloading and attempting to use the original files in the "Original-NoFixes-DLC" folder, especially on real hardware.
